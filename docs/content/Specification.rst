   heading
   track point heading
      The heading of a track point is the nautical or geographical Azimuth, the clockwise in degrees measured angle between North and the heading direction.
      (North = heading of 0째; East = heading of 90째; South = heading of 180째; West = heading of 270째)

   street segment origin offset
      It can be necessary to split a street given by a data source into multiple street segments, e.g. because of junctions.
      We explain the idea of the offset by the following example.

         Original street map

      By splitting the original street segment 3 at the junctions with the original street segments 1 and 2 we created three street segments corresponding to the original street segment 3, all starting at a different offset.

         Created street segments

      In the end we have (street ID, offset) tuples. Such a tuple defines the beginning of a street segment. While
      the end of the street segment can be reconstructed implicit by adding the coordinate count of the street segment to the offset.

   street segment origin ID
      To a :term:`street segment` corresponding ID from the original data source.
