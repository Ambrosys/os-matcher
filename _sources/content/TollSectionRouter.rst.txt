Street map considerations
-------------------------

All streets of the OSM street map have a certain `HighwayType` (see `osm wiki <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway>`_). The :term:`OS-Matcher` does only consider the following:

* motorway
* trunk
* primary
* secondary
* motorway_link
* trunk_link
* primary_link
* secondary_link

That means streets that link smaller towns and villages are not considered.
